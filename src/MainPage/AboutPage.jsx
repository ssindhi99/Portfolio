          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
I am a passionate professional currently working as a Product Manager in a dynamic media company. I truly enjoy my job, where I get to strategize, lead, and drive impactful projects. In my free time, I indulge in website surfing, which has sparked a deep interest in coding and web development.
          </p>

                    <p>
Driven by curiosity and a desire to challenge myself, I chose to learn JavaScript—one of the most in-demand and versatile programming languages. My learning journey began with mastering HTML and CSS, followed by JavaScript, and further advanced to building web applications using ReactJS and Redux.

                    <p>
As a creative thinker, I find immense satisfaction in designing websites and applying logic to make them functional and engaging. Despite coming from a non-IT background, with a Master’s in Commerce, I am committed to growing as a front-end developer while continuing to thrive in my current role.

          </p>
                    <p>
I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute meaningfully in both areas, blending my passion for technology with my expertise in product management.
